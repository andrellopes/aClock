// Example placeholder for FlutterFire options.
//
// This file is provided so the repository can be public without shipping
// your real Firebase API keys. In your local environment, generate the real
// `lib/firebase_options.dart` by running the FlutterFire CLI:
//
//   dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
//   flutterfire configure
//
// After generating, DO NOT commit `lib/firebase_options.dart`.
// It's already listed in .gitignore.
//
// If you really need a compile-time placeholder, you can keep this file and
// change your imports to conditionally include it only in OSS builds.
